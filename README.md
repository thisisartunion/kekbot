### To-do (priority = more-or-less the position, kinda):
- [ ] Improve dailies, change to a non session based (AKA, persistent database) database system for the project, 
~~then turn it into more of a qna setup, kinda like yui's ras system~~ <br> Too convoluted (the qna thing), alrd tried this out with archv. 

- [ ] Chat tracker 

- [ ] Auto portfolio archival

- [ ] DB sided portfolios 

- [ ] NSFW filter thing

- [ ] Search for a host to permanently host this on, cached memory wouldn't be a problem any more hopefully by this point. Would help transfer of ownership as well. 

- [x] Create an automated system for porto ordering (Prolly detect if a message is sent in a porto that is in porto category and contains image embed(s)) 
> Done. 3 lines minimum for writing, one attachment, or a link otherwise.

- [x] uhh, decide which stikman is bes kekman in #kekbot 
> Gib bleach.

- [x] Auto prize distribution
> unb api is using outdated Axios, will update later, might also make a pull req ifn't lazy.

- [ ] Make an event command based on daily setup, remove daily setup command entirely afterwards 

- [ ] Create an auto porto index system, intending to format it like hope, probably have to use trigger words for this one 

- [ ] Make a command module handler

- [ ] Improve coding overall, would probably take the longest time, so dat why tis here 

- [ ] Add the infinite emoji library thing, (concept is in local, dont even ask abt it.)

- [ ] Add countdown system, then make it so that
It slows down or speeds up the time that an api request is sent based on number of currently active countdowns 

- [ ] Create a au-exclusive DRM system. Initial idea was to go with blockchain-based, but saw some academic papers criticizing it. Current idea is to just use kekbot as a back-end doc verifier.
